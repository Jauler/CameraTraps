# Camera traps for Citizen Science

## Description

Aiming to build cheap Camera Traps that could be easy enough to build and use for citizen science by Tanzanian schools. This is meant both as a wildlife protection and an education effort.


The concept relies on using a Raspberry Zero - it's functionality (particularly ability to connect any webcam, which mean high quality surveillance), and low cost is what makes it perfect and accessible for building DIY Camera Traps in Tanzania and absolutely elsewhere in the world.


Cheap DIY Camera Traps can become a universal tool that will upturn the current citizen science and educational practices in this area, as currently available Camera Traps are difficult to afford (cheapest being ~$100 per kit), which limits citizen science efforts greatly, especially in developing countries.
We aim for ~$15-20
